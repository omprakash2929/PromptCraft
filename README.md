    With **PromptCraft**, you just type your *raw thought* and let the system          structure it into a professional prompt.  
    This saves time, removes frustration, and ensures you get the **best possible AI output**.  


- 🧠 **AI-powered with Google Gemini API**  
    **Gemini** brings advanced reasoning and contextual understanding.  
    By integrating it, PromptCraft ensures your prompts are not only well-written but also  **optimized for clarity, tone, and impact**.  
    That means less trial-and-error and more **productive results on the first try**.

    Sometimes you don’t even know where to start.  
    PromptCraft offers ready-made **prompt templates** for common use cases like YouTube videos, blog writing, technical specs, and emails.  
    This makes it **super easy for beginners**, while still giving **power users flexibility** to customize.
